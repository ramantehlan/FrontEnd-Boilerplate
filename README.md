## About

The purpose of this project is to have a Frontend Boilerplate which is easy to understand and work with and can be quickly used in other projects without the need to write everything again. 

I created it for personal use, but feel free to use it for your project or maybe for a hackathon. I have tried my best to explain the in-depth working of this boilerplate.

## Usage

To use this Boilerpate, make sure you have all the `pre-requisites` and your `development environment` is ready. After that you can read about the `file-structure`, which also explains about project struction and how things are working in background. Commands will tell you about the important `commands` you should know.

### Branches

We are following agile continuous integration methodology, so the version is frequently updated and development is really fast.

1. **`stage`** is the development branch.

2. **`master`** is the production branch.

3. No other permanent branches should be created in the main repository, you can create feature branches but they should get merged with the master.

**Steps to work with feature branch**

1. To start working on a new feature, create a new branch prefixed with `feat` and followed by feature name. (ie. `feat-FEATURE-NAME`)
2. Once you are done with your changes, you can raise PR.

**Steps to create a pull request**

1. Make a PR to `stage` branch.
2. Comply with the best practices and guidelines e.g. where the PR concerns visual elements it should have an image showing the effect.
3. It must pass all continuous integration checks and get positive reviews.

After this, changes will be merged.
